Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

resubmission reflection:

1. Cafe
    No Exception to attempts to move off 1st floor
        fixing this by adding an runtimeexception when user didn't go to 1st floor in cafe.
2. general
    Missing or inappropriate @param / @return in Javadoc & Adheres to Java conventions on naming & capitalization
        fixing this by writing all comment and check name format


I use overload mostly on constructor because it would have more flexibility for object reaction, also, it allows us to have clearer code. And I also overload the moveout() in house class. The method would be easier for code reader to understand.
